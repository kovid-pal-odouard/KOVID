            Much of the scholarly literature on revolutions seeks to answer the question: why there and at that time, rather than most other places at most other times? Oppression, inequality, poverty, and arbitrary rule have been aspects of human societies near-ubiquitously for centuries, yet the vast majority of the time those conditions alone are not enough to lead people to revolution. Thus, when revolutions do occur, it is difficult to think about them in terms of their local context alone – scholarly approaches to revolution, therefore, tend to have some element of justifying (in the causal sense, not the moral sense) why a revolution happened <span class="italic">there</span> and <span class="italic">then</span>.

            Alexis de Tocqueville (1856) noted that as the old feudal order deteriorated, the English nobility assumed tax “burdens in order to enjoy the power of governing; here [in France] they steadily refused to pay taxes, as their only consolation for the loss of political power” (125), leading to the dissatisfaction of a wide variety of classes forced into bearing the weight of archaic feudal structures nothing in return. For Hannah Arendt (1963), revolutions could not happen without the addition of the imagination of a post-scarcity New World to the western canon. For Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (1858), revolutions could not happen without a suitably antagonistic relationship between two classes. Charles Kurzman’s (2004) account of the Iranian revolution is in terms of “viability:” the reason it reached the critical mass of demonstrators involved was because of a (contingent) public perception of the revolutionary movement as viable.              
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Whereas all these scholarly approaches to revolution may seem very different – Tocqueville and Marx focus on class relations; Kurzman denies the assumption that revolutions are written in inevitable sociological forces and provides an “anti-explanation” (5) of revolution as being contingent on people’s experiences and perceptions; Arendt is concerned with where the imagination of revolution comes from – they still share this fundamental similarity. As shown by Kurzman’s case, the question is not necessarily: why did it have to be there and then? For him, it didn’t. The questions are: why there? Why then?               
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The approach here does not seek to answer such questions, though it does not seek to discount their importance in any way. Instead, it looks to identify the characteristics of and differences between revolutionary cultures (particularly in their relationship with literature) in France and in Russia. It is an examination of the merits of several possible accounts on the nature of cultural paradigms, rather than an attempt at one causal explanation (though could potentially be put into conversation with the latter). It is an approach that conceives of those at the forefront of the revolution – its leaders and primary actors – as a cultural group with its own set of practices and internal logic worth understanding (and potentially, as only being understandable through multiple different accounts.)

            While an account of revolutionary cultures as seeking to translate to reality the visions of their founding authors may initially seem intuitive, such an account falls apart fairly quickly. Voltaire advocated a constitutional monarchy, whereas Rousseau believed the will of the people could not be expressed through representatives and that a direct democracy was therefore necessary. Neither of those contradicting visions were put into practice by French revolutionaries: how are the actions of the revolutionaries from Louis XVI’s death at the guillotine to Thermidor to be understood as such? 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            This framework is not particularly useful for understanding the Bolsheviks’ actions, either. Despite the strong body of literature written by Bolsheviks on correctly putting Marx into practice, Russia did not correspond to an orthodox Marxist vision. Marx’s dialectic requires many steps prior to a proletarian revolution: feudalism must be abolished by a bourgeois revolution; the bourgeoisie, pursuing profit, must simplify class antagonisms by congregating people of all lower classes as their urban labor force and bring about an industrial revolution of the means of production in the process (Marx and Engels, 15-21). Unfortunately for this account, Russia did not fulfill a single one of these prerequisites: it was still a feudal nation; the vast majority of its population were peasants. If Russian revolutionary culture’s goal really was to put into practice, as Lenin put it, “what Marx really taught us” (5), then Russian revolutionary culture would not yet exist!

            Perhaps a more useful account of these nations’ revolutionary cultures and their relationship with their respective literatures is as follows: revolutionary cultures were not necessarily looking to enact the teachings of their literary predecessors, but their literary predecessors gave them a language they used to conceive of themselves and their goals. François Furet’s analysis (1981) of French revolutionary culture is a compelling case for such an account. For him, “French society… was desperately searching for responsible spokesmen” (36) – it could not find such a spokesmen in the parlements, as they “throughout the century, gave repeated proof of their conservatism, since they condemned the Encyclopédie” (36), among other offenses (given they were, after all, a body composed of nobles) so French society turned to the philosophes. This phenomenon can even be conceived of as a structural tendency: the steady loss of political function of the nobility in the years leading to the revolution (a fundamental shift corresponding to the decline of feudalism) without the Ancien Regime allowing for a new ruling class “set up the writers as imaginary substitutes for that ruling class” (36).

            Regardless of whether this perception was a question of the contingent dispositions of French revolutionary culture or a structural tendency in French society, it serves as a framework to understand revolutionary culture from 1789 to Thermidor. For Furet, the revolution operated by “appropriat[ing] for its own benefit the interpretation of what was meant by the ‘people’s will’” (43). As such, Sieyès’ famous “What is the Third Estate?” conceived of the nobility as existing outside of the people, therefore legitimizing the ostracization of nobles and the symbols associated with them. Later, each successive government relied on the language of the people’s will for its legitimacy. On Robespierre from 1793-1794, Furet writes:
